Insulin for pets is currently taken from human insulin sources. These sources are not diluted for animals and measurement can be difficult due to the small amount required for treatment. Additionally, the measurement printing on the syringe can be inaccurate. While this inaccuracy is not critical for human dosing, the error is dangerous for pets. Insulin for Kitties will be writing software for the Apple iPad and iPhone to combat this issue. This program will use an image recognition application to measure insulin in a syringe. Known radius values shall be used in conjunction with scalar measurement calculations to correctly measure and display proper dosage information to the user.
